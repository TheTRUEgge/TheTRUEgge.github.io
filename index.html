<p>Human and Pokemon. Because I'm utter trash </p>
<p>That's what Sunlocke is. It's also a Nuzlocke if that's up your alley. </p>

<img src="Sunlocke0Yo.jpg" alt="I refuse to elaborate on the condition of my team.">
<p>This was an experience, that's for sure. I used a sunset tutorial that I would up enjoying, scrapped a few ideas, and wound up with this. Good times! </p>
<img src="Sunlocke1.jpg" alt="Already one death. Not a good start.">
<p>Fun fact: When I was inking this, I had actually just got new inking pens, so I was experimenting with them. This is why my inking is so inconsistent in the first couple of pages... Okay it's always inconsistent actually. </p>
<img src="Sunlocke2.jpg" alt="His name is Tyler. I say this because in my infinite youth of wisdom, I neglected to mention it.">
<p>Buildings will be the death of me, I swear. Thank goodness Alola hardly has any cities. I also decided to just go with the MYSTERIOUS STRANGER just disappearing as it suits him.</p>
<img src="Sunlocke3.jpg" alt="I take this cutscene more seriously than anybody on the planet. Shut up.">
<p>Ow I hate this page. So, so much. It actually hurts, the amount of hate I feel towards it. Kukui is terrible, Ann isn't drawn well, and Nebby... well, Nebby is perfect. These days, I'd probably split it into two pages, but I don't feel like redrawing this any time soon. </p>
<img src="Sunlocke4.jpg" alt="Well, I was going to choose the Rowlet, but the Popplio is female! Now I'm conflicted.">
<p>Oh, phew, this page isn't terrible. I actually like the first two panels quite a bit. I stand by those. </p>
<img src="Sunlocke5.jpg" alt="The page that proves I was never conflicted at all.">
<p>And so, Grasshopper joins the team. I love this small bean.</p>
<img src="Sunlocke6.jpg" alt="Woody never has black on his face again. Though it isn't black technically, it's 70% Warm Grey. An e because it's a European company.">
<p>I think this was the first page that I really enjoyed drawing. Before, they were kind just ehh as I waited to get to the good parts. I actually wrote an entire paragraph of Woody talking about bugs that's going on behind his character. Don't remember what it was about, though. </p>
<img src="Sunlocke7.jpg" alt="Ann cry count- 1">
</p>Second favorite page of Chapter 1! Oh man, I adore this page. Sunset, flowers, dumb Nebby joke... the whole Sunlocke package! It's what I'm about, really. </p>
<img src="Sunlocke8.jpg" alt="Hala pretends to be omnipotent but Ann sees past that Taurous Poop."</p>
<p>And so ends Chapter 1! Probably going to be the shortest chapter because oh man this was rushed. I just really wanted it to be done, and I made a lot of beginner's mistakes. Luckily, the next chapter <i>definitely</i> fixes those mistakes, right?... Right?.. </p>
<img src="Sunlocke9.jpg" alt="Nebby isn't screaming coffee in the second-to-last panel, in case you were wondering.">
<p>Elain! Elain is super fun, but I keep catching birds. Why. Seriously, this felt like a Flying only locke for a while. And Woody considers sailing a ship before page 10! You go, bird. </p>
<img src="Sunlocke10.jpg" alt="Foreshadowing. Calling it right now.">
<p>Thankfully, Grasshopper convinces Woody to not. Good job, Grasshopper. His stuttering is also getting worse somehow. Huh. </p>
<img src="Sunlocke11.jpg" alt="I knew it! I also wrote it but, well, details.">
<p>The way Ann talks to Ms. Emily is also how I talk to teachers soemtimes. My teachers love me. </p>
<img src="Sunlocke12.jpg" alt="Only dramatic evolution ever. Probably.">
